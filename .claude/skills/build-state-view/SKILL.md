  Implement read slices the Cratis way — a [ReadModel] record with static query methods, fed by a
  Chronicle projection or reducer, plus the React component that renders it. Use when: (1) implementing
  a new read slice / projection in a Cratis project, (2) a slice.json has a non-empty readModel /
  projections / queries section, (3) the user provides a read-slice Event Modeling artifact or
  specification and asks to implement it, (4) the user says "implement", "create", "add" a read slice,
  read model, projection, reducer, or query in a Cratis Arc / Chronicle project.

# Cratis — Read Slice (State View)

A read slice projects events into a queryable read model. In Cratis the path lives in **one `.cs`
file**:

```
[ReadModel] record + static queries  →  projection or reducer  →  dotnet build  →  React
```

> **Read first:** [../_shared/cratis-conventions.md](../_shared/cratis-conventions.md). Everything
> below assumes those rules.

## Step 0 — Discover conventions

Read `.build-kit/CLAUDE.md` and one existing read slice. Confirm the namespace root, how existing read models
declare queries (snapshot vs observable), whether projections use model-bound attributes or
`IProjectionFor<T>`, and the MongoDB collection wiring. Resolve slice `comments` when done (see the
state-change skill's Step 0 for the resolve endpoint).

## Step 1 — Understand the input (`slice.json` is the source of truth)

| Element | What to extract |
|---|---|
| **Read model** | Name, fields, the key field |
| **Source events** | Which events feed each field (projections **join events, never read models**) |
| **Queries** | The queries to expose; whether each is snapshot or real-time (observable) |
| **Specifications** | Each scenario → an executable spec proving the projection result |
| **Storylines** (optional) | `storylines[]` — ordered walkthrough "beats"; a read-model chain in one is a supplementary spec source, see Step 4a |

If a field has no source event in `slice.json`, do not invent one. One read model per use case —
never reuse a model across slices.

## Step 2 — Write the slice `.cs` file

`<Module>/<Feature>/<Slice>/<Slice>.cs` — namespace `<Root>.<Module>.<Feature>.<Slice>` (mirror the folders; drop any `.Features.`).

### Read model + static query methods
```csharp
[ReadModel]
public record AuthorListItem(AuthorId Id, AuthorName Name, int BookCount)
{
    public static async Task<IEnumerable<AuthorListItem>> AllAuthors(
        IMongoCollection<AuthorListItem> collection)
        => await collection.Find(_ => true).ToListAsync();

    public static async Task<AuthorListItem?> GetAuthor(
        AuthorId id, IMongoCollection<AuthorListItem> collection)
        => await collection.Find(a => a.Id == id).FirstOrDefaultAsync();

    // Real-time push — return ISubject<T> directly (never Task<ISubject<T>>)
    public static ISubject<IEnumerable<AuthorListItem>> ObserveAllAuthors(
        IMongoCollection<AuthorListItem> collection)
        => collection.Observe();
}
```
- `[ReadModel]` required. Query methods are **`public static`** on the record; the method name becomes
  the TS query proxy class name. No controller, no `IReadModels`.
- Favor reactive (`ISubject<T>`) queries when the slice wants live updates.

### Choose projection vs reducer
- **Projection** — shaped read models, field mapping, joins, children (most read slices).
- **Reducer** — running aggregates (balances, counts, sums) where state accumulates across events.

### Projection (declarative; AutoMap on by default)
```csharp
public class AuthorListItemProjection : IProjectionFor<AuthorListItem>
{
    public void Define(IProjectionBuilderFor<AuthorListItem> builder) => builder
        .From<AuthorRegistered>(from => from.Set(m => m.Name).To(e => e.Name))
        .From<BookAdded>(from => from.Add(m => m.BookCount).With(_ => 1));
}
```
Or model-bound shorthand for simple cases:
```csharp
[ReadModel]
public record AuthorInfo([Key] Guid Id, [FromEvent<AuthorRegistered>] string Name);
```

Projections/reducers are discovered automatically — no registration. See
[references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md) for joins, children, composite keys, and reducers.

## Step 3 — Build

`dotnet build` from the project root — zero warnings / errors. This generates the query proxy the
frontend imports.

## Step 4 — Specs

Write specs proving the projection/reducer produces the expected read model from a sequence of events —
one spec per scenario in `slice.json`. Run `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~<SliceName>"`.
See [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md).

## Step 4a — Storyline-derived specs (optional)

If the slice's `storylines[]` array (in `slice.json`, alongside `specifications[]`) is non-empty —
a storyline embedded in this slice's slice.json already belongs entirely to this slice, no need to
match beats against `readmodels[]` by id/title — look for a **read-model chain**: two beats of
`type: "READMODEL"`, with only `EVENT` beat(s) between them. That's a self-contained projection
spec:

- **Establish** — append every event from the storyline's start up through the intervening
  event(s), in order.
- **Because** — run the projection.
- **should_\*** — assert against the *later* beat's `fields`/`examples`/`expectEmptyList`.

Put these in their own `for_<ReadModel>/when_<storyline-title>/` folder (not `when_<behavior>/`),
so they're never confused with the exhaustive `specifications[]` suite — a storyline is a
narrated walkthrough, not exhaustive coverage.

If the storyline's transition into this read model is instead `COMMAND → EVENT → READMODEL`, only
the `EVENT → READMODEL` half belongs here — the `COMMAND → EVENT` half is a separate spec in
**build-state-change** (see its Step 5a). Don't try to assert read-model state from a dispatched
command in one spec unless the project already has an established pattern for that.

Skip a beat sequence entirely — no spec, no placeholder — if it can't be isolated (e.g. a SCREEN
beat with no traceable event). A storyline is source material for tests, not a mandate to write
one for every beat.

## Step 5 — Frontend

Add `<Module>/<Feature>/<Slice>/<Component>.tsx` importing the co-located generated query proxy from
`./` (`MyQuery.use()` snapshot, `MyQuery.useWithPaging(pageSize)` for paging, observable proxy for live
data; or `DataTableForObservableQuery` for a table). Add a barrel `index.ts`. Register it in the
feature's composition page; add routing in `App.tsx` if it's a new page.

## Final verification — does the implementation match `slice.json`?

- [ ] Every read-model field → a record property fed by a projection/reducer mapping.
- [ ] Every source event used exists; projections map from **events**, never read models.
- [ ] Every query in the slice is exposed as a static method; observable where the slice wants live data.
- [ ] Every scenario → an executable spec.
- [ ] A `storylines[]` read-model chain for this read model has a spec, or was deliberately
      skipped (not silently ignored).
- [ ] `dotnet build` clean; specs pass.
